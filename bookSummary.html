					<li data-theme="d">Julius Caesar tells the story of the great Roman General, Julius Caesar and the conspiracy, 
					which has him assassinated. A group of conspirators has come to be convinced that Caesar plans to take the
					Roman democracy and turn it into a monarchy under strict rule by Caesar. The conspirators believe that they 
					must prevent this and in turn vow to kill him. The group of conspirators even consists of some of Caesar's 
					believed to be close friends. One in particular, Brutus, is convinced that even though he is a friend with Caesar, 
					he is doing the right thing for his country. Other conspirators seem more motivated by jealousy of Caesar. 
					Caesar is actually warned of his potential murder yet is too proud to listen to the prophecies and actually
					walks right into his death. The group of conspirators takes turns stabbing Caesar until he collapses. The 
					character Brutus, who is actually the featured character in the play, takes the opportunity to announce the 
					reasoning behind the murder. At first it seems understandable, however another character Mark Anthony makes a 
					statement that turns the audience and citizens of Rome against the conspirators. The conspirators are then run out of Rome. 
					The final act tells of a bloody and tragic battle, the Battle of Philippi. Many of the conspirators are killed many 
					of which are more so fighting for themselves rather than their country. At the end of the play Mark Anthony takes an 
					opportunity to acknowledge Brutus who dies in the battle. Brutus, though he conspired to kill Caesar, was actually a 
					true hero as his intentions were entirely for his country and he fought to his death rather than commit suicide like 
					other conspirators did during the battle.</li>
