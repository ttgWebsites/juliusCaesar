					<li data-theme="b">After Caesar's death Octavius becomes his successor, how does Octavius carry on with Caesar's legacy and goals?</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Caesar is such a powerful and well-respected leader that any words he says must be acted upon because he has issued them.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Following his death, no one has quite that power until Octavius steps up as a leader; it is seen on the battlefield when Octavius commands the army and they willingly obey his commands.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">When Caesar was a leader, those below him viewed him with such awe and respect that they elevated him to nearly the level of the Gods.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Octavius seems to posses the same charisma as Caesar in that he is captivating and convincing in his words, he is well respected by those below him and they begin to elevate him to Caesar's level and see him as the natural heir to Caesar.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">Caesar was obviously mortal as proved by the conspirators, however as a public figure he was elevated and respected at the level of a near immortal. Was he still able to hold power after his death, and did the conspirators actually do the opposite of what they intended in his death by making his power immortal?</li>
					<li data-theme="d">As Caesar's impending death approached, it was quite obvious he was mortal. He had begun to visibly age; he was becoming death, and was possibly epileptic.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">However when he was killed it seemed as if his public image did not die with him, and those who loved and obeyed his rule perhaps elevated it.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Antony seems to enhance his image after his death with profound words on the leader of Rome.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">His death brings about rebellion against the conspirators as many want to avenge the loss of one of the greatest leaders ever known.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Octavius steps up as a great leader and follows the precedent Caesar set when he was in power.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Others even refer to Octavius as Caesar as he exhibits many of Caesar's qualities.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">It seems as if Caesar's death actually made those in Rome much more strong, and it shows that even though if he was physically mortal, his legacy was anything but.</li>
