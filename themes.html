				<!--For each section, paste the text in place of the bolded keyword-->
				<!--Copy more from <ul *to* /ul> if more themes needed-->
				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">Fate and Caesar's view of it</li>
					<li data-theme="d">A theme in this play is that of one's fate</li>
<li data-theme="c">Caesar at one point makes a statement regarding death, stating that it will come whenever it comes, and that it is inevitable, therefore one shall not fear it</li>
<li data-theme="c">Everyone's fated to die, therefore one shall not let fate stop them from living life</li>
<li data-theme="c">It is Caesar's view of fate that makes him such a powerful leader before his death as he does not let it prevent him from living life to the fullest, as he does not fear anything because he believes whatever happens is fated to do so</li>
				</ul>
				
				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">The power of spoken words</li>
					<li data-theme="d">During the play we see the power Caesar has with his words, his is very well spoken and well respected as a leader</li>
<li data-theme="c">Whenever he commands something it is done without hesitation as he is very wise and convincing</li>
<li data-theme="c">Also other characters seem to posses the power move people with their words</li>
<li data-theme="c">Antony is very quick witted and when he speaks to the other conspirators, he easily convinces them that it is the right thing to assassinate Caesar</li>
				</ul>
				
				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">The difference between public and private life</li>
					<li data-theme="d">A prime example of the theme that many lead different lives when in public as apposed to alone or in the company of those they are close to is Brutus' assassination of Caesar</li>
<li data-theme="c">Brutus respects Caesar, and the two appear to be close personal friends, however Brutus is swayed by what he thinks the public opinion is about Caesar to murder him in order to create a new ruler</li>
<li data-theme="c">Caesar's death is another prime example as Caesar is asked to stay home due to his wife's fear of his death, however Caesar, after first obliging her, decides he will go to a senate meeting where he believes he will be receiving the crown</li>
<li data-theme="c">This is his major downfall as he wants to uphold his public image and believes he can not be harmed, however instead he loses his life because he can not balance his private and public life</li>
				</ul>
				
				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">The downfall of misinterpretations</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Throughout the play the reader sees that misinterpretations usually cause a persons downfall, while on the other hand someone who does not make that mistake usually survives</li>
<li data-theme="c">A few examples seem to resonate with this theme. Cassius' death is the result of him believing Titinius has died. Titinius is in fact not dead, but Cassius does not foresee this, and subjects himself to death</li>
<li data-theme="c">Caesar's death is the result of misinterpretations as well. Cassius convinces others that Caesar being coordinated, as a leader will lead to their downfall as he misinterprets signs. Thus Cassius is able to convince Brutus that Caesar's death is necessary, when in fact the signs were really showing Cassius' imminent downfall</li>
